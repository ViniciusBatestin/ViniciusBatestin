<h1 align="left">Hi 👋, I'm Vinny</h1>

<p align="left">I am a Computer Science student at the University of London (Goldsmiths / Remote), with a strong interest in Python and React projects, as well as artificial intelligence and machine learning.</p>

🫶 I’m currently working on three pro bono projects.

🦾 To deliver on the 28/11/2025: https://www.getinlinebrand.com, a recycled vintage clothing company eCommerce called **Get In Line**.

⚡ I'm looking to collaborate on Python, React, projects, particularly those that have the potential to positively impact society.
