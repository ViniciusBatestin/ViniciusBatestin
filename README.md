<h1 align="left">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Vinny</h1>

<p align="left">I am a Computer Science student at the University of London (Goldsmiths), with a strong interest in Golang and React projects, as well as artificial intelligence and machine learning.</p>

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on DataVis, a project focused on visualizing a variety of datasets to enhance data representation and insights. 

ðŸ¦¾ I recently completed a [Game Project](https://github.com/ViniciusBatestin/GameProject/settings/pages) where I designed a character that navigates through the screen, collecting treasures and jumping over cliffs.

âš¡ I'm looking to collaborate on Golang and React projects, particularly those that have the potential to positively impact society.
