<h1 align="left">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Vinny</h1>

<p align="left">I am a Computer Science student at the University of London (Goldsmiths), with a strong interest in Python and React projects, as well as artificial intelligence and machine learning.</p>

ðŸ«¶ Iâ€™m currently working on three pro bono projects, building their first websites: a recycled vintage clothing company called **Get In Line**, an art and music community called **Re-clubbing**, and an independent artist named **Misha1Dem**.

ðŸ¦¾ I recently completed: [Little Lemon Restaurant](https://viniciusbatestin.github.io/little-lemon-project/), a **React Capstone Challenge from Meta**. This task involved designing a fictional restaurant and developing a table booking process.

âš¡ I'm looking to collaborate on Python, React abd Golang projects, particularly those that have the potential to positively impact society.
